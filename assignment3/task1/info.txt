Task 1:
1 Install Minikube to create a single-node cluster on your local machine. Choose the option that uses Docker.
2 Deploy a single-container app: The goal of this task is to create a pod that consists of one container. Use an image of your preference and create a deployment via Kubernetes.
Explain the commands you used to view your deployment and how you are going to check your cluster’s runtime.
3 Configure Kubernetes Dashboard (GUI)
(https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/dashboard/)
4 Apart from the kubectl, use the Kubernetes Dashboard too for deployment and provide YAML templates and screenshot.

Attention! For the next exercises make sure that a Minikube cluster is up and running.
